Results
Billings Christian School was using an old, analog security system with only a few cameras in use. With recent news of security concerns at schools, the school knew that they needed to upgrade to a modern, advanced system to ensure the safety of their students. They reached out to DIS to plan and install a system that would monitor every aspect of the school campus.
"Garrett did such a great job. He was very thoughtful and knowledgeable in helping me! My previous IT provider was not able to resolve my computer issue but Garrett was able to fix the problem in about 15 minutes. He made sure all the problems were resolved and he thought ahead to what else I may need. I really appreciate DIS!"
