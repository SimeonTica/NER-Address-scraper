We make complex
medical science accessible!
Our customers are medical affairs and medical marketing teams responsible for scientific communication about innovative pharmaceutical and biotech products.
With our unique visual storytelling approach, we help them explain complex scientific topics to internal as well as external audiences.
Visual storytelling approach
Graphics, animation, and concise text have an enormous impact on how people perceive a given topic. That’s why at CAST PHARMA,
we combine medical and creative expertise to close the gap between scientific communication and graphic design.
We develop unique visual stories for our clients in the following main areas:



Visual storytelling formats
We deliver visual stories in the familiar formats that have been shown time and again to meet our client’s needs from congress booths to medical training. Unlike overengineered apps and VR, these tried-and-true deliverables are easier to review, update, and distribute. This means they can go live sooner and get used longer, thereby reaching a larger audience over their lifespan.



Proven in-house expertise
The right team for the job
We employ 70+ skilled professionals including: medical experts, project managers, graphic designers, 2D and 3D animators, usability experts, editors, and technical specialists.
