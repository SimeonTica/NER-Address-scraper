Engraving
Nothing conveys an extra-special sentiment quite like a piece of engraved jewellery. Whether it’s a pendant to commemorate a birthday or that perfect engagement ring, engraving just adds that extra touch of magic to any piece.

Want to add that little special something and really make your gift personal? At present this service is available on selected items for just £15. With years of experience behind them, you can be sure that our engravers will give your Clogau items that personal touch that you desire.

Compose
The concept of a jewellery ring is simple, yet keeping the design contemporary, meaningful and elegant is an art within itself. Using a wide range of quality materials – such as gold, silver and diamonds – our designers thrive on the challenge of developing unique ring designs that make you stand out in the most beautiful and stylish way possible.
