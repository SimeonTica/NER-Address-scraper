Inside The Draft: Luke Easterling talks Colts' draft needs and wide receiver targets
In this week's episode of Inside the Draft, Matt Taylor and Casey Vallier are joined by NFL Draft analyst Luke Easterling from Athlon Sports. Luke highlights the Colts' major needs in the draft and shares his thoughts on the increasing recognition of quarterback JJ McCarthy's talent. He breaks down why he thinks the Colts should target a pass rusher in the first round and how they could address their need for additional receivers after round one.
Official Podcast: Chris Ballard and Shane Steichen at NFL Annual Meetings
The Official Colts Podcast is back this week as Larra Overton and Matt Taylor discuss Shane Steichen's comments on a potential return of Anthony Richardson who is expected to be fully healthy to begin the offseason workout program in a few weeks. We sit down for exclusive interviews with Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard in Orlando from the NFL Annual League Meeting. Finally, we wrap up the podcast by examining some rule changes that were approved this week, including the ban of the "hip drop" tackle and a significant change to kickoffs that will take effect in 2024.
