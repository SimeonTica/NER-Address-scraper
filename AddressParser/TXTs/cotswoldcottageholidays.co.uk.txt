They are well located for touring around the local Cotswold towns and villages, with Cheltenham and Stratford each just 25 minutes drive. If you prefer a peaceful get away from it all break, then these cottages all have beautiful gardens to enjoy and are close enough to the centre of Broadway village to walk in and sample the great selection of museums Pubs and Restaurants, array of independent shops and its own Steam Railway station. For those keen walkers Broadway has a wonderful selection of walking routes and is also situated on The Cotswold Way national trail.
