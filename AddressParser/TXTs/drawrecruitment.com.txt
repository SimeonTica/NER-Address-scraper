We come highly recommended:
“I contacted DRAW because I needed very specialist advice on an important clock collection which involved clocks by the premier names of English clock making. At the time I was on holiday but by the time I returned, DRAW had organised a specialist with many years’ experience who catalogued the collection to a tight deadline, with condition reports and invaluable advice on cases, movements and makers. The whole process was made easy by DRAW. and was excellent value for money and I would not hesitate to recommend them. ”
