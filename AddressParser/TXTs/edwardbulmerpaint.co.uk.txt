A creative workforce! We spent yesterday morning @royalacademyarts with @walpole_uk for #luxuryinthemaking. @walpole_uk are the voice of the British luxury sector, representing over 250 of the UK's finest brands, of which we are one, having been selected as a Brand of Tomorrow in 2023. The Luxury market is made up of businesses delivering dynamic growth & protecting the high value, highly skilled jobs the sector supports whilst bringing in a monumental ¬£81bn per year to the UK economy. From innovation and distribution to the artisans behind not only our brand, but all of the leading brands that make up the rich tapestry and eco-system of the Walpole repertoire. From skill sets that need investing in and preserving, to unique craftsmanship, @walpole_uk's new luxury report explores the culture and individuality behind the brands it represents, we are so excited to move forward with them and be natural paint representatives! From time to time, we all need encouragement to step outside our silos by collaborating, building relationships with fellow makers, designers, builders and creators. Focusing on ‚ÄòThe aura of luxury‚Äô whilst looking at circularity from all perspectives, means British luxury can raise the bar globally. Creating more jobs, furthering education, embracing diversity and always leaving room for growth and transformation. So, join us @edwardbulmerpaint as we continue to embrace pivotal change and focus on sustainability, beautiful interiors and colours without compromise, the proof is in the pÃ∂uÃ∂dÃ∂dÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ paint! A natural paint solution available for all, for people and planet before profit. *This report was collated in association with @frontierecon
Our fabled ‚ÄòFawn‚Äô at the home of @nigelslater. These neutral tones evoke such serenity, perfect for a Sunday. Stoney hues such as ‚ÄòFawn‚Äô, ‚ÄòStone White‚Äô and ‚ÄòPortland‚Äô are origin colours, which explains why they induce feelings of calm and homeliness. Stone is a precious material that humankind have used for millennia, and is the foundation and building block of history and architecture. Read more into our neutrals on our website and if you‚Äôre thinking of re-decorating this Spring, sign up to ‚ÄòThe Colour Supplement‚Äô where week by week we share with you palettes, styling and colour advice, see you there!
