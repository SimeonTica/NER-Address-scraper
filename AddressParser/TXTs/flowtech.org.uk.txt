Flowtech Water Solutions
Flowtech Water Solutions are experts in water services and water booster sets. We have continuously supplied a wide range of standard and custom products since being founded in 1996.
Now established as a major force in the market, partnering nationally with local councils, design engineers, mechanical contractors, developers, and end users.
Our company has a strong customer service ethos that has been shown in previous projects and the need to respond quickly to whatever our client’s requirements are. Flowtech Water Solutions will handle projects from initial enquiry/tender to design and through to order placement and on site commissioning followed by an annual maintenance contract if required.

Flowtech operate a network of Service Engineers located throughout the UK. The distribution of engineers means that in the majority of cases we are less than 2 hours away from attending a customer call out.
We place great emphasis on providing technical back up to support our Service Engineers and in resolving some difficult operational and technical issues. We pride ourselves on completing a project on time, within budget and never leaving a problem unresolved, or a customer waiting. This quality of service has made us the first choice for our customers.
