A Playlist for the Entire Family
The Fargo Kiwanis Young Children Project is partnering with the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra to produce a family-friendly classical music playlist for people of all ages to enjoy — “Welcome to a World Filled with Beautiful Music!” Brochures featuring the project are distributed at FM area birth centers to new families, and with a quick scan of a QR code, families are taken to the playlist of recordings by FM Symphony and FM area musicians to enjoy with their children.
