Holdsworth Chocolates have been creating exquisite handmade chocolates in the heart of the Peak District since 1988
It’s been over 30 years since my mum, Barbara started making chocolates from a small unit in our home town of Bakewell, driven by a passion for chocolate with a firm belief that a market existed for British handcrafted chocolates. Barbara began to blend the best possible ingredients from around the world in order to realise her dream.
