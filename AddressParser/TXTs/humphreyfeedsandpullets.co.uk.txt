Everything we know goes into
Advancing Poultry Performance
As a dedicated free range poultry feed and point of lay pullet supplier, there is only one thing we want to do with the knowledge we have gained – share it with our customers.
We understand that every flock is different, so that is why everything we do is designed to meet the individual needs of your flock. 
Whether mimicking conditions in our pullet rearing houses to match those of your laying sheds, or creating a bespoke conventional or organic free range poultry feed diet to meet your flock’s needs, our team of highly experienced and knowledgeable poultry specialists will work with you at every step of the way to help optimise the performance and welfare of your birds.
