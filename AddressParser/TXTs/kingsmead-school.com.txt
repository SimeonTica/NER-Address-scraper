ACHIEVING
THROUGH
CARING
CARE • ASPIRATION • RESPECT • DETERMINATION
WELCOME TO KINGSMEAD
At Kingsmead we believe in achieving through caring. Our educational philosophy is a simple one, that as a school we have a duty of care to look after the well being and development of every child –  whatever their ability or circumstances. We give all students the tools to access a fulfilling life, realise their potential and prepare them to play their part in society.
A triangle of partnership is the linchpin formed between school, students and parents/carers to support students to make the best possible choices.
Mr J Eddy, Headteacher
