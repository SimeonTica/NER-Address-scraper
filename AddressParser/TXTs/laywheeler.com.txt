2021 Palmer Historical XIXth Century Blend, Vin de France
Dry | Red | Still | 13.5%
This is the 11th modern iteration of Château Palmer's Historical, a blend of Bordeaux and Syrah from the Rhone Valley. Château Palmer created this blend as a homage to the days when Bordeaux proprietors would often blend in Syrah to add heft to their Cabernet. Syrah lends the wine a smooth richness, broad mouth-coating tannins and savoury truffle and black pepper aromas.

2020 Ao Yun, Yunnan
Dry | Red | Still | 14.5%
The 2020 Ao Yun is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, 6% Syrah and 6% Petit Verdot, grown across the four villages at different altitudes. Deep purple, with equally purple dark fruit, with cassis, black plum dominating, and blueberry and mulberry providing aromatic lift. On the palate are layers of mineral, crushed rock, fresh mint and wild sage, more noticeable in this 2020 iteration than in the plumper 2019 vintage. At this early stage there is also lots of oak character with clove, smoke and creamy vanilla The tannins are fine, ripe, mouth-coating and rounded, and there's plenty of refreshing acidity and mountainous character, lifting to a long, fine finish.

2015 La Grande Année, Champagne Bollinger
Dry | White | Sparkling
2015 La Grande Année sees Bollinger on fighting form: striking the balance between opulence and elegance like no one else can. It is generous, voluptuous and refined, encapsulating what Bollinger aptly calls “the velvet bubble”. Its backbone of Pinot Noir gives depth and complexity, and will ensure good ageing potential. But it’s worth noting that the house has chosen precisely the right time to release the 2015: it is a sensational glass right now, so if the temptation is strong, do not hesitate to open this straight away and enjoy the amplitude as it unfolds on the palate. It will not disappoint.

2021 Château d'Yquem, 1er Grand Cru Classé Sauternes
Sweet | White | Still | 13.9%

This is a Yquem that will last for decades beautifully, with a seam of electric acidity providing a frame for a long life in bottle. Dried orchard fruit, fresh mandarin, honeysuckle and a waxy note on the nose, and then more restrained than usual on the palate, with more fresh citrus and honey.

2017 Château Latour, 1er Cru Pauillac
Dry | Red | Still | 13%
Chateau Latour 2017 is expressive and aromatic, with medium body and moreish saline notes. The tannins are just starting to soften and create a lovely textural frame around bright red and bramble fruit. Floral notes and more salinity build on the finish. This is a classy and ethereal expression of Latour.

2018 Les Forts de Latour, Pauillac
Dry | Red | Still | 14%
Chateau Latour's second wine in 2018 shows the concentration and density of the vintage, with intense dark fruit and licorice. Earthy notes and aromatic incense add complexity, and there are lots of velvety, dense tannins. This feels approachable, but has serious heft that will soften with more time in bottle.
