Our shopping centre includes high street favourites like Costa and Greggs as well as local independent retailers such as Boston Soap and Phoneguys.
You can shop for everything from books and stationery at Waterstones or The Works bookstore to music and film at HMV or buy a new mobile at our O2 outlet or get your everyday essentials from Wilkos or Superdrug.
We are an external shopping centre with our adjacent car park.

Pay-stations are located on the ground floor (through the tunnel between Wilkos and Bonmarche) via the pedestrian exit, using either cash or contactless card payments.
