PIPERS CRISPS
We make bold flavoured crisps using the finest potatoes seasoned with carefully sourced unique flavourings. Working with passionate ingredient partners who care as much about their own produce as we do ours, Pipers create crisps as they should taste.
OUR STORY
The Pipers story began in 2004 when three farmers - Alex Albone, Simon Herring and James Sweeting - joined forces to produce great tasting, quality crisps using the finest potatoes.
Working with carefully selected flavour partners who care as much about their products as we do about ours. The Pipers brand is made up of passionate people driven by one thing and that is to deliver the best taste and quality possible.
This passion for taste and quality is common across the Pipers team.
It's about crisps as they should taste.
