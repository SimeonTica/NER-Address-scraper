Innovative products.
We have been working with plista for about half a year now. Our goal is to increase our brand awareness and to draw attention to our innovative technology and products. Through plista, we reach target groups that we previously had difficulty reaching. Since we have been running plista Native Ads, both the number of visitors to our informational website and the demand for our innovative products in the B2B sector have increased. plista offers a modern portfolio of advertising solutions, which we enjoy using and which we can implement due to plista’s great consultative measure.
