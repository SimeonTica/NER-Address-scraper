We digitise trade
Our clients, on average, save more than 1% on the cost of everything that they source.*
That is a saving of $1m on every $100m of goods they purchase from their supply chain.
And our clients have generated $millions in additional working capital by adding automated supply chain finance at enterprise scale - using our "cash against data" financing technology.
* Our award-winning technology generates savings for companies of all sizes, from multinationals down to SMEs - extending and automating supply chain finance out to enterprise scale and adding the collection of ESG and evidential paperwork at product-level to avoid WROs and meet marketing and sustainability requirements.

Digitizing trade - it is easier than you think!
Each time suppliers ship, they upload and self-digitize their paperwork on our secure portal. That's everything: transport documents, packing lists, invoices, purchase orders, certificates, bills of materials, supply chain maps, inspection reports etc
This provides amazing, structured and rich transaction data across the whole enterprise to drive forecasting, planning, automated payment approvals, and ESG compliance - both inland and cross-border, both services and products.
Go live without an initial IT project.
  Simply introduce your suppliers to us, we switch them on, data flows, savings can be generated.
Team
We digitise trade by getting suppliers to self-digitise their paperwork. Our technology enables supply chains to be run more efficiently and more ethically - generating savings for buyers, democratising the treatment of suppliers and driving new levels of reporting for ESG and sustainability.
Our senior management team has decades of experience across supply chain, sourcing, trade and the working capital - and a unique perspective on the future of supply chain management.

Tim Nicolle
Founder & Chief Product Officer
Tim founded Demica and has held senior roles at Deutsche Bank and Unicredit in London and was a partner in PwC. 
  Tim brings detailed business knowledge, organizational skills and experience. He founded PrimaTrade after seeing how operational and data problems across supply chains lead to unequal treatment of suppliers. He realised that fixing the data problem could then drive a significant democratisation of the supports available to suppliers, levelling the playing field and helping to address the global SME financing gap in trade.
  Tim is the lead creative force behind the company’s products.

Why digitize your enterprise supply chain?
    See everything across all carriers, forwarders, geographies, products, ERPs, brands, categories and suppliers. Manage FX risks, cash flows, sourcing, forecasting and logistics from the top down rather than the bottom up.
Offer early payment at shipment to all your suppliers  and save an additional 1%+ on spend. If you already have an SCF program, keep your existing funders and their platform, we can enhance your program without changing any of these.
Meet new ESG regulations, track the credentials of products and services that you source; collect and evidence ESG characteristics at product or SKU level.
