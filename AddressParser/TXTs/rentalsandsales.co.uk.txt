What people say about us
A very honest and ethical agency that is trying to change the reputation given to estate agents. I feel they act in the clients interest instead of their own and I had a pleasant experience while selling my property. Highly recommended.
My relationship with Rentals&Sales started few years back with an amazing place to live they've provided me with. I've never had any issues, staff was always nice and approachable and I would definitely like to stay in touch in case I'd be planning to move back into the area. So far it's the best letting agency I've been in touch with and I can't express how sad I am that our relationship comes to an end. I can strongly recommend them with full confidence of them not letting you down, ever.
- Lukasz Raczylo
Very quick to respond and to resolve the issues. Especially Cheryl and James are very friendly and professional at the same time. Also, if you're a tenant, there is no agency fees! What else would you ask for? I would recommend
