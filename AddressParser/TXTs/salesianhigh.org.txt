Steeped in the Catholic faith and educational tradition of
St. John Bosco, Salesian High School is a home, a school,
a parish and a playground. Our diverse community of
young men preparing for college and meaningful careers
are encouraged to become men of character, leadership
and service in a global society. We foster life-long
friendships in a welcoming family environment that
stresses a rigorous curriculum, creative arts, strong
athletics and service to others.
