Just finished a private 2-day GELATO COURSE for top pastry chef Gerard Apurado.

Day 1: learn ingredient balancing for granita and sorbetto.
Well-earned lunch including sampling local cakes torta di verdura coi becchi and castagnaccio.
Into the lab to make lemon granita, lemon and strawberry sorbetto.
The day's production is stowed in the freezer to taste again the next day. Yes, it matures and tastes better.

Day 2 learning ingredient balancing for gelato and production in the lab.

Presentation of the certificate of the course by Mirko Tognetti to model student Gerard. Will he abandon his prize-winning cakes for gelato?

We're making REAL BREAD without an oven. It's called fogaccia leva di Gallicano.

Mix flour, yeast, salt and water. Knead. Leave to rise. Make small balls of dough. Leave to rise. Heat your cotte (iron disks) over a burner and grease well. Place a ball in the centre of one. Put the other on top. Press hard with a robust stick. Cook for about 5 minutes turning several times.

It's great to be back making mozzarella on our MOZZARELLA & ITS COUSINS course.

Almost 4 hours ago we started with buffalo milk, added whey starter, then rennet, then cut the curd, weighted it, and waited for it to acidify, kept testing the acidity, and finally arrived at the 'filatura' stage where you melt the curd in hot water, fold it to incorporate water and then cut the mozzarellas off with our thumbs.

If you're a cheesemaker (home or professional) there's one place left for you on our course from 25 February‚Äì1 March.

In December 2023 UNESCO recognised 'The practice of opera singing in Italy' as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

We're proud to boast that we got there way before UNESCO! We've been including opera in our tours for years. Opera and a pasta lesson, opera and gelato and, in November, opera in a villa.

Who thought farmers have an easy life?

We're at Fattoria di Lamole üçá 20 years ago owner Paolo Socci was busy restoring the dry-stone walling hidden in the woods on his family's wine estate because he needed the radiator-effect of the stone. Now, due to global warming, he's creating new terraces 200 metres higher up because he needs cooler nights.

Being attuned to the needs of your vines pays off. The wine from each vineyard is so distinctive that even amateurs who drink for pleasure can appreciate the differences.

Taste for yourself üç∑ We visit Paolo on our Autumn in Tuscany and Tuscan Heritage tours. More info at:

RICE FROM FARM TO FORK on day 3 of the Giants of Sardinia tour.

We're at RisOristano with rice farmer Marcello Stara. One of the agricultural giants of our tour. Here we are marching along the track between two fields of rice.

We're fascinated by some of the ingenious ways Marcello works with nature to grow rice organically. While harvesting the rice (in about two weeks), the egrets feast on the grasshoppers that might damage the crop next year. Over the winter the fields will be grazed by sheep which eat the weeds and fertilise the land. In the spring he does a 'false seeding'. He ploughs the fields, but instead of planting rice seed, he allows the weed seeds to germinate. After a couple of weeks, he ploughs them under and sows his rice. They sprout quickly and cover the ground, shading out any remaining weeds.

Back at Marcello's home, his friend Rossella is ready to demonstrate how to cook risotto. And there we are, forks in hand, tucking into a quintessential Sardinian risotto made with mutton and pecorino.

Today is San Michele's day (St Michael). I started looking out for him after I saw the magnificent statue on top of San Michele church in Lucca.

Here's my latest find in San Michele church in Lucignana near where I live. In case you don't know the legend, the Archangel banished Satan from Heaven. Often Satan is portrayed as a dragon, but here he's an ordinary man with a beard and a receding hairline‚Äîperhaps more like the devils we encounter in real life.

Michele's head is far too small for his body, but I love the swirling cloak and golden sandals tied on azure socks. The painting looks to me like a copy of a more accomplished one by Guido Reni 1636.

San Michele was important to the Longobards, who ruled much of Italy between the fall of Rome and the conquest of Charlemagne. In fact he has two days in the calendar, 29 September and 8 May. I've been told that on 8 May shepherds left the lowlands near the coast to take their sheep to the alpine pastures for the summer and came down again on 29 September.

This is important‚ÄºÔ∏è Read the whole post and support The Real Bread Campaign. They are not fighting to ban anything except misinformation. They are fighting for honesty and transparency in food labelling so you, the consumer, can choose. You don't have to be based in the UK to become a member.

We need to raise awareness everywhere of
‚úÖ the misuse of names (like 'brioche') to enhance sales
‚úÖ the importance of reading labels
‚úÖ what ultra processed food contains

And we need real bread to be available everywhere üí™

I‚Äôve been waiting and waiting for bitter oranges to arrive to make marmalade. Finally they‚Äôre here!

Yesterday Mattia and Nicola and I made 54 jars! I call it Baghdad marmalade because I got the recipe in 1967 when I was excavating a neolithic site in Iraq. It requires bitter oranges, lemons, limes and grapefruit and is tart and refreshing.

It was tiring but lots of fun. And being in Italy of course we had to have a 4-course lunch even if it was slotted in between working on the marmalade.

FEBRUARY 2013, but no snow so far this winter. Never fear, says an old adage I learned from Renato in the village shop this morning:

In winter if there is no snow yet, it will surely arrive. In summer if it isn't hot yet, don't hold your breath.

I often worry about how sustainable travel can really be, especially for my clients coming from the States, Canada and Australia. Maybe you too wondered whether the carbon offset offered by airlines really helps. Hard to know.

At the ABTOI Association of tour operators to Italy summit last week, I met Toria from Trees4Travel. They plant trees to absorb CO2, and even more importantly help fund wind farms. They do the research for us and select worthwhile projects.

Since I was about to fly from the UK to California, I decided to try it. On their website I entered my journey and they advised I needed to plant 22 trees which would cost ¬£66. I can see on the map that they'll be planted in Jodhipur, Nepal. It's so much fun looking at it, and I feel much better about the trip.

I'm going to buy trees for every one of your bookings with me, but that won't be quite enough. Have a look at this worthwhile project and plant some trees yourself.

An archive might sound boring, but the teachers and librarians on our AUTUMN IN TUSCANY tour were in 7th heaven when Giovanni Fascetti told us that they had discovered that the backs of mediaeval manuscripts had been used by the tribunal at the Rocca di Vicopisano. There's even a page from Boccaccio's Decameron.

And of course the view from the tower down the Imperial Canal toward the Arno was the icing on the cake üßÅ

Beer? Italy? YES! There are now hundreds of craft breweries in Italy and at least 13 in the Province of Lucca.

I'm always excited when someone chooses beer tasting. We go to De Cervesia Beer&Shop where in their cool cellar owner Michele Sargenti tells us the astonishing fact that the brewer Felix Pfanner came to Lucca from Austria and began brewing beer here in 1846!

He and his brother personally choose the craft beers they stock. Michele's enthusiasm is catching. We can't wait to taste each of the four beers he's chosen for us. Then, at the end, a surprise ‚Äî a hybrid between beer and wine called Limes. I won't tell you anymore. You have to come taste for yourself.

One other surprise: there's a new brewery at Lucca that is making superb gluten-free beer! So if you're gluten intolerant or have celiac disease and have been craving beer, come to Lucca.

Inspiring other people is one of the greatest pleasures of running my tours and courses ‚ù§

After a Tastes & Textiles tour in June, Barbara wrote:

I enjoyed every single day of the Hanging by a Thread tour!

In the course of ten days we made: bread, cheese, luxury sandals, a seven course lunch with an agri-chef, a broom and we wove on an antique hand loom. We spent time with local craftspeople who: farm, make cheese, grow silk worms, practice blacksmithing at a water powered mill and a weaver who weaves on industrial fly shuttle looms.

We ate wonderful meals with local wines at local restaurants. We were able to relax in accommodations that were comfortable and private and welcomed us warmly and made such wonderful hospitality for us as a small group.

I appreciated being able to learn about Tuscany and the Garfagnana with Erica who cares very deeply for her region and has cultivated relationships with local craftspeople.

I enjoyed each day and will relive this tour in my memories for years to come.

Have you tried to make mozzarella from videos on the internet or taken a course and it turns out they only teach you the last 5 minutes of a 4-hour process?

It doesn't have to be that way. Our head cheesemakers teach every step starting with the milk and ending with the perfect mozzarella. Along the way you learn to measure acidity with an acidometer, mature the curd, test whether it's ready for the filatura, do the filatura and form the mozzarella (see all the photos to get an idea). You learn the reasons for every step and are ready to return to your own dairy to practise until you have a perfect product.

Second stop on our MOZZARELLA & ITS COUSINS course is Prime Querce dairy at Capaccio.

Head cheesemaker Antonio Daniele is our teacher. He smiles as he remembers that when he started as an apprentice in 2013, all he knew about milk was that it was white. Now it's his best friend. He understands all its moods. Supported by the rest of his team, he can coax it into becoming the cheese he needs.

He's an inspiration to our students Hugo Guest of Glebe House Devon and Barnaby Meredith who is on a mission to found a regenerative buffalo farm.

Day 1 of the ADVANCED SALUMI COURSE TUSCANY didn't go according to plan. We usually go to Massimo Bacci, but due to a death in the family, I had to find an alternative at the last minute. Marco Bazzichi, a winemaker I'd met at Massimo's, was the hero who rode to the rescue.

After following him up a steep, tortuous mountain road, we arrived at his agriturismo with a panoramic view from France on the right to Elba on the left.

Inside the cosy room Marco toasted bread over a fire and drenched it with his new olive oil, a delicate one milled from the Quercetano variety of olives found only in the area around Pietrasanta.

He had gone early that morning to get some of Massimo's salumi so the butchers, pig farmers and chefs on the course could at least taste what they weren't learning to make.

The culmination of the visit was tasting Marco's natural wines. We all bought several bottles to take home, and I'm definitely going back soon. Who wants to join me?

Grazie, Marco!

AUTUMN IN TUSCANY Day 2: What happened on Day 1? Storm Ciaran. But never mind, we started day 2 with a truffle lunch and then a visit to my new find:

The whole town of Cerreto Guidi (and part of Vinci) crocheted by Gessica Mancini and #ledamedelluncinetto. That's Gessica in black on the right‚Äîa truly amazing woman. Nine years ago, at the age of 40, with 3 young children, she was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. To dispel her gloom, she started crocheting a presepe (nativity scene).

It won first prize in a presepe competition, which inspired her to keep crocheting. She says the work has a magical effect. When she crochets, her trembling stops. Doctors, take note!

I hope you haven't been holding your breath for the second half of Day 4 of the Giants of Sardinia tour. Sometimes life is more important than FB posts, but here we are again.

We're learning to make the Slow Food Presidium cheese #casizolu at Peppino Sanna's farm and dairy.

Casizolu is a pasta filata cheese, in the same family as mozzarella and caciocavallo. It takes at least 4 hours to prepare the curd. We arrive for the fun part of forming the cheese in its traditional shape. Peppino shows us how and then everyone has a go.

Time for dinner of course. We're the excuse for Peppino's niece Chiara along with the rest of the family to assemble for a party. All homemade food, some things we've never tasted before, each one more delicious than the last! What warm welcoming people!

Mostly nothing because there are too many. Some people make jam. These from Sicily can be peeled and eaten as a fresh fruit. Cinzia at the fruit stall in my local market explained that there are three kinds in these boxes, red, orange and yellow-green. Despite the different colours, they're all ripe ready to eat.

Have you ever tasted a prickly pear?

Agostamento from the Italian for August is the ripening of grapes for wine.

Here are pinot nero (or pinot noir in French) grapes at Cantina BRAVI enjoying their last days in the sun. In a month from now they'll be on their way to becoming wine.

Did you realise how small pinot nero grapes are? You need exactly the right soil and micro-climate and great skill to turn them into good wine. Luckily for me and you if you visit with me, Alessandro Bravi has both.
