The UK's Largest and Most Trusted Supplier of Staff Absence Protection
Working exclusively in education since 1997
SAS were the first provider to offer a dedicated Staff Absence Insurance product to meet the needs and demands of schools in protecting against staff absences. In the 27 years since, SAS have tirelessly worked with schools, academies, trade unions and education leaders to provide practical and effective support to UK schools.
It was this that led SAS to develop a comprehensive Health and Wellbeing Support package which comes at no additional cost with every SAS policy. This provision is extended and improved every year so our community of schools and academies can benefit from services which have been proven to help prevent and reduce absences in schools.
