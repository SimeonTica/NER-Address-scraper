CUS­TOMER FOCUS
Customers of industrial high-tech products attach particular importance to good service. For Spectra as a supplier of high-quality products, competent, personal support before and after the purchase therefore has a high priority.
We do not have an anonymous call center. Our customers have a personal contact person at their disposal at all times, who handles inquiries and tasks with expertise and experience in a committed, cooperative and goal-oriented manner. With solid expertise and common sense, we have been a reliable business partner for our customers since our founding. 
Solutions are designed transparently and on schedule, complex tasks are projected by means of a specification sheet. Efficient ERP-supported project management and our well-coordinated team help our customers to save time and money.

Most of our customers use our industrial PCs for their automation tasks. They benefit from our many years of experience in the automation environment.
You decide whether a pure IPC component or a coordinated component bundle or a ready-to-use industrial PC system or a special solution is the best choice for you.

IPC Components
The field of automation is very wide-ranging, which is why we have specialised in the topics of industrial communication (industrial networking) and smart automation with a focus on all-in-one solutions and IIoT applications.
With our extensive know-how, we can offer you different approaches to solutions for your tasks.
