Helping Young Adults Grow Together Since 1982
We serve young adults aged 18-28:
who experience mental health issues that impact mood and relationships.
who may struggle with daily activities such as school, employment, or other aspects of adult life.
who may suffer from co-occurring substance use.
who may engage in addiction-related compulsive behaviors.
who may struggle with social skills, self-esteem, or a sense of purpose.
who are seeking therapeutic residential treatment support in reaching vocational, educational, and independent living goals.
If you or your child thinks Spruce could be the right fit, we would love to hear from you.
