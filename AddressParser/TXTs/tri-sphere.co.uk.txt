CUSTOMER SERVICES AND OFFERS
Tri-Sphere provides a range of additional services to bodyshops and to garage workshops.
Recalibration is as essential for compliance with quality service standards as it is for ensuring that all vehicle repairs are carried out safely.
Equipment Servicing and a preventive maintenance programme ensures that your equipment – and your business – continues to run smoothly and efficiently.
It’s worth noting that the recalibration of Globaljig Systems may highlight the need for repairs (damaged measuring tapes, for example) that our skilled technicians can complete at the same time. Few general recalibration service providers have the parts to be able to do this.
We also provide offers on new and refurbished equipment from our various product ranges. Take a look at our Featured Offers, below.
