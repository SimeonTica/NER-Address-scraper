FDA’s Final Rule Overview of Quality System (QS) Regulation/Medical Device Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP)
In 1987, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued the first version of ISO 9001, a standard intended to define the basic requirements, structure, responsibilities, and procedures required to implement an effective quality management system for manufacturing organizations in general. In 1996, the International Organization for Standardization issued the first version of ISO 13485, “Quality Systems—Medical Devices—Particular Requirements for the Application of ISO 9001,” to specify, in conjunction with the application of ISO 9001, the Quality Management System (QMS) requirements for medical device manufacturers. Today, ISO 13485 is used internationally by many regulatory authorities as the foundation for defining regulatory QMS requirements for medical device manufacturers and is utilized in regulatory harmonization programs such as the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).

Prefilled Syringes, Notified Bodies, and the Submission File – Have You Figured It Out Yet?
Have you successfully developed a drug product in a prefilled syringe and are now wondering how to get it on the European market?
According to the European Union Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) Article 1(9), a prefilled syringe (PFS) is identified as “a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination, and which is not reusable, that single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable” (1). According to 2017/745 Article 1(9), you must prove that the device part of your combination product complies with the appropriate General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) laid out in Annex I of MDR. As you can no longer do a self-assessment, you will need to reach out to one of the currently designated 43 Notified Bodies in Europe (2) to do the conformity assessment for you. The results of the assessment are then captured in the Notified Body Opinion (NBOp) which you are required to include in the submission file to EMA or your national competent authority.
