Christmas Jumpers
...should be handmade because Christmas is all about the extra quality and cuteness handmade brings. That's why our festive sweaters, Christmas jumper dresses, aprons and Xmas t-shirts are made by us. Everyone deserves to look and feel this cute at Christmas:

Who is this Woolly Babs?
She's called Babs and she's really woolly. She only recently discovered a demand for what she makes when people tried to buy an Xmas jumper off her son wherever he wore it. This was a bit of a shock and still makes her nervous. Find out more about us.
As worn by...
Our novelty knitwear has been proving very popular. They've been worn by David Hasselhof and Keith Lemon on Celebrity Juice, by Chantelle and Alex Reid for a shoot, and appeared on the BBC where they were voted 'not hot' by The Wanted!

We now offer so many different designs that you can easily find the perfect Christmas jumper for every member of your family.
Not only are our Christmas jumpers different, so are we! We're a small family business based in the Yorkshire Dales not far from Leeds and Bradford.
We're all involved in designing, making and even modelling our Xmas outfits. This lets us keep everything a little bit on the quirky side, but also means we're totally contactable.
Get in touch! We can customise a jumper or create something totally unique for you. You might just want one that isn't red. We can do that too!
We take custom orders all year round and it's better to get in touch before October as we might be too busy after then.
Start off by taking a look at our full collection of Christmassy jumpers.
Even more designs for year-round silliness!
We've moved beyond just novelty Christmas jumpers. See what else Babs has made that might tickle your fancy!

Woolly Babs loves making Christmas jumpers. She'd have to - she makes them all year round!
Here she is showing off a whole year's worth of fashionable jumpers and wearing one of her Christmas aprons.
Woolly Babs loves to sew and she loves to knit. For her jumpers (Christmas, Halloween and Easter alike) she thinks that sewing is better than knitting. She has many a reason.
Babs lovingly sews our jumpers because:
  a) she can give them so much more character
  b) the designs are much bolder
  c) where would she put the squeakers if they were knitted?!
  d) they can be any shape and size - look out for what's coming up later in 2018 in terms of Christmas jumpers... you've never seen the likes of it
Babs has got better and better at making novelty clothing and has been able to keep adding new designs that she develops with her son.
Every year we offer new designs and new twists. These are industry firsts such as
The Bah Humbug anti Xmas jumper
The Transform your jumper into a Christmas Jumper service
The Front and Back Rudolph Jumper
  See how she makes our Christmas jumpers here. Or watch a video of Babs introducing the special features of her Pablo Penguin jumper.
