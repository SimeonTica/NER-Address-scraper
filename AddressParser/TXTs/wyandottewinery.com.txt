 "This is my favorite place to come for a glass of wine. It is a quaint place with delicious wine and snacks. The staff is amazing and they make you feel right at home. I have recommended this winery to all my friends and they love it too."
Be sure to visit our sister winery, Rockside Winery and Vineyards located just north of Lancaster, Ohio.
