WELCOME TO ZUMAJAY SURF SHOP

Zuma Jay Surf Shop is one of the longest established surf shops in Europe and a small independent surf shop based in Bude Cornwall. We pride ourselves on our surf knowledge and advice. Being the founding member of the ’F.S.S.S' (Federation of Surfers Surf Shops) we are a surf shop run by Surfers.

All of our staff surf and have an in-depth knowledge of the equipment we sell. We stock a large range of the leading surf brands including Xcel Wetsuits, C-Skins Wetsuits, Arcade, Softech, Mick Fanning, Vision, FCS, Future Fins, Protest Boardwear and Reef.

As a wetsuit specialist we stock a huge range all year of mens, ladies and kids wetsuits. Our shop has been situated on the North Cornwall Coast since the early 70’s. Not only do we specialise in surfing and bodyboarding but we offer a range of watersports equipment including stand up paddleboarding and swimming. Our online shop offers our whole range of surfboards and surfing equipment. Here at Zuma Jay we are also a Custom Surfboard manufacturer. Our boardroom includes boards from three local surfboard shapers but also we stock surfboards from Pyzel Surfboards, Channel Island Surfboards, Takayama Surfboards, Surftech Surfboards, Walden Surfboards, Tahe Surfboards, NSP surfboards and Zuma Jay and Sick Pig Surfboards. Custom Surfboard making allows us to get a board exactly suited to our customers needs and you can have you very own unique design put on it too. Our shop opens all year round for advice and surfboard hire.

Contact us any time on the phone or online - happy days with Zuma Jays!
